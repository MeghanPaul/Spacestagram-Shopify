# Spacestagram
A webpage that pulls the last 10 days of Astronomy Pictures of the Day using NASA's APOD API. Each picture is displayed with its corresponding title, date, and description. Responsive like, dislike, and share buttons are included at the bottom of each card.

### Features
Each set of like and dislike buttons are mutually exclusive. If "like" is active and "dislike" is clicked, "like" will deactivate and "dislike" will activate, and vice versa. If an already active like or dislike button is clicked, it will deactivate and not affect the other button. 
When the share button is clicked, it will become filled, and the url for the image shown on that card will be displayed below the button set for the user to copy.

### Tools Used
